To build Flex system:

        Assemble INIT.TXT
                 SPOOLER.TXT
                 BIOS.TXT

        APPEND INIT.BIN SPOOLER.BIN FLEX.COR BIOS.BIN FLEX.SYS

        The fie FLEXINIT is and older version of the two files INIT and
        SPOOLER combined without the Time setting function. It's only
        kept around for posterity. It's really not needed.
