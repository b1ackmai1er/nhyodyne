# nhyodyne: A Modular Backplane Computer (MBC)
# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to revisit the design concepts behind my original Z80 SBC (aka test prototype) which has evolved into the SBC V2-005 over several years. Attempt to introduce some new concepts to make the design more modular, flexible, and less expensive. Use low cost prototype PCBs (100x100mm) available for less than $20 including shipping from JLCPCB. Make simple single function boards to implement good program design concepts from Computer Science: high cohesion and low coupling. Maintain as much backward compatibility with latest SBC V2 as possible.

# Overview
The MBC consists of four core boards: Z80 backplane, Z80 processor, Z80 clock, and Z80 ROM. These are sufficient to build a working system of minimum capability. However  the core boards are designed in such a way that they can be individually redesigned and replaced with improved designs and/or customized to suit the builder. It achieves low coupling by implementing a simple bus using off-the-shelf 2Ã—25 2.54mm spaced pin headers and socket strips. The backplane is a replication of a fully buffered Z80 CPU pin out in the same order. Each board has high cohesion by being limited to a single function consisting of only parts specifically related to to perform its task. This lowers builder cost by eliminating unnecessary parts and improves system reliability by having fewer parts to fail. Likewise, if a component or whole board fails it can be replaced without affecting the remaining boards.

# Tools
Open Source tools and software are used to the maximum extend possible to keep costs down for people building the Z80 MBC.  The target software for Z80 MBC is ROMWBW and is supported in the Dev Branch.  All boards are designed using KiCAD version 5 or later and FreeRouting for PCB trace autorouting.  Gerber files are supplied for most boards and can be obtained from JLCPCB or the PCB manufacturer of your choice.

# Additional Design Goals
There are several additional design goals for the Z80 MBC.

First, is to ease constraints on the design to allow for some new configurations. Specifically capability to access memory over the bus and configurable memory map holes for external memory.

A second design goal is making all IO devices optional, fully configurable, and limiting IO port addresses to only the minimum necessary. Multiple IO devices can exist in the system simultaneously or not exist as the builder chooses. Lowers cost and improves system reliability by removing unneeded and/or unwanted capabilities.

The third design goal is allowing multiple memory modules with boot enable jumpers to specify boot devices present after CPU reset.

Fourth, adding simple debug features like user LEDs and a switch.

Fifth, implementing a fully buffered Z80 processor with configurable wait state capability and no internal IO or memory devices. Related is each board is also fully buffered to keep bus signals only on the bus with no raw bus signals intruding into the board past the buffers.

Sixth, maintain backwards compatibility to the extent possible (two exceptions so far) to reuse existing SBC software. Target software is current ROMWBW

Seventh, lower build cost by using inexpensive off-the-shelf components and PCBs. All parts come from Jameco or eBay (like bus connectors). Use simple 9vdc 1A unregulated power supply. Keep part count on boards low so they are effectively disposable eliminating the need for sockets and further lowering builder costs. Make non-essential components optionally do-not-populate.
